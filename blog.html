        <p><p>It’s become something of a cliche that algorithms are everywhere. An enormous
number papers—including many of my own!—begin with some variation on the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
    Algorithmic decision-making systems are increasingly used to make decisions
    that affect people's lives in health care, criminal justice, lending,
    college admissions, hiring, and more. That means that, like the human
    decision-makers they've replaced, biases in these systems can harm racial
    and gender minorities or other marginalized groups.
</blockquote>
<p>The cliche remains relevant because the problem is real: algorithms <em>do</em> make
increasingly important decisions, sometimes to
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/researchers-find-racial-bias-in-hospital-algorithm-11571941096">disastrous effect</a>.
The question, though, is, what should we do about it?</p>

        <p><p>U.S. police officers pull over tens of thousands of drivers every day, making
traffic stops the most common way people interact with law enforcement. They’re
also a frequent source of tension: Black drivers are stopped and searched at
higher rates than White drivers, and Black drivers are more likely than White
drivers to say they were stopped for illegitimate reasons. Traffic stops can
result in fines or the loss of a driver’s license even in the best cases, and
can escalate to violence in the worst.</p>

        <p><p>Can algorithmic fairness ever be harmful, even to the people it’s intended to
protect? For some time, researchers have known that adhering to common
algorithmic fairness criteria like equalized false positive rates <em>can</em>,
counterintuitively, lead to worse outcomes for marginalized groups.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"></sup> The
crux of the issue, however, is not <em>if</em> such fairness criteria can be harmful,
but <em>how often</em>. In our new paper on causal fairness, “<a href="/papers/causal_fairness.html">Causal Conceptions of
Fairness and their Consequences</a>,” <a href="http://hamedn.com">Hamed
Nilforoshan</a>, <a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/ravi-shroff">Ravi
Shroff</a>, <a href="https://5harad.com">Sharad
Goel</a>, and I tried to make rigorous the intuition that, for
a growing number of fairness definitions incorporating causal reasoning, the
answer is “almost always.”</p>

addition to a large library of standard mathematical functions (e.g.,
\(\exp(x)\), \(x^y\), \(x + y\), \(\Gamma(x)\), etc.)—it also supports
the use of higher-order functions, such as such as solving a user-specified
system of ODEs. This greatly expands the range of Bayesian models Stan can
handle.</p>
