    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>A potential voter must incur a number of costs in order to successfully cast an
in-person ballot, including the costs associated with identifying and traveling
to a polling place. In order to investigate how these costs affect voting
behavior, we introduce two quasi-experimental designs that can be used to study
how the political participation of registered voters is affected by differences
in the relative distance that registrants must travel to their assigned
Election Day polling place and whether their polling place remains at the same
location as in a previous election. Our designs make comparisons of registrants
who live on the same residential block, but are assigned to vote at different
polling places. We find that living farther from a polling place and being
assigned to a new polling place reduce in-person Election Day voting, but that
registrants largely offset for this by casting more early in-person and mail
ballots.</p>
