    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Despite the rise of digital media, Americans are five times more likely to
consume news via television than through online platforms. However, due in
large part to technical hurdles, it remains unclear what content appears on
broadcast news and how the mixture of content has changed over time. We
consider these questions by applying a novel LLM-based approach to an
understudied corpus of expert-generated summaries of virtually all news
segments aired on the “big three” broadcast networks—ABC, CBS, and
NBC—between 1968 and 2019. Results based on nearly one million news segments
show that “information density”—the amount of time dedicated to political
issues—has declined substantially over the last 50 years. Today, broadcast
news spends twice as much time on commercials and “soft” news and half as much
on issue-based political coverage compared to a few decades ago. Since the
early 1990s, the news has also shifted inward, focusing more on domestic
stories and less on international affairs. These changes suggest a
transformation in the informative role of broadcast news, raising questions
about its impact on voter knowledge and political engagement.</p>
