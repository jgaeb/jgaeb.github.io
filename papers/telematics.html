    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Past studies have found that racial and ethnic minorities are more likely than
white drivers to be pulled over by the police for alleged traffic infractions,
including a combination of speeding and equipment violations. It has been
difficult, though, to measure the extent to which these disparities stem from
discriminatory enforcement rather than from differences in offense rates. Here,
in the context of speeding enforcement, we address this challenge by leveraging
a novel source of <em>telematics</em> data, which include second-by-second driving
speed for hundreds of thousands of individuals in 10 major cities across the
United States. We find that time spent speeding is approximately uncorrelated
with neighborhood demographics, yet, in several cities, officers focused
speeding enforcement in small, demographically non-representative areas. In
some cities, speeding enforcement was concentrated in predominantly non-white
neighborhoods, while, in others, enforcement was concentrated in predominately
white neighborhoods. Averaging across the 10 cities we examined, and adjusting
for observed speeding behavior, we find that speeding enforcement was
moderately more concentrated in non-white neighborhoods. Our results show that
current enforcement practices can lead to inequities across race and ethnicity.</p>
