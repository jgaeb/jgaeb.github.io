    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>We prove that for infinite rank-one transformations satisfying a property
called “partial boundedness,” the only commuting transformations are powers of
the original transformation. This shows that a large class of infinite
measure-preserving rank-one transformations with bounded cuts have trivial
centralizers. We also characterize when partially bounded transformations are
isomorphic to their inverse.</p>
