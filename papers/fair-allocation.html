    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Public and private institutions must often allocate scare resources under
uncertainty. Banks, for example, extend credit to loan applicants based in part
on their estimated likelihood of repaying a loan. But when the quality of
information differs across candidates (e.g., if some applicants lack
traditional credit histories), common lending strategies can lead to
disparities across groups. Here we consider a setting in which decision
makers—before allocating resources—can choose to spend some of their limited
budget further screening select individuals. We present a computationally
efficient algorithm for deciding whom to screen that maximizes a standard
measure of social welfare. Intuitively, decision makers should screen
candidates on the margin, for whom the additional information could plausibly
alter the allocation. We formalize this idea by showing the problem can be
reduced to solving a series of linear programs. Both on synthetic and
real-world datasets, this strategy improves utility, illustrating the value of
targeted information acquisition in such decisions. Further, when there is
social value for distributing resources to groups for whom we have <em>a priori</em>
poor information—like those without credit scores—our approach can
substantially improve the allocation of limited assets.</p>
